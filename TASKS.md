- Created a central configuration system for security settings
- Enhanced logging for security-related events
- Added proper error detection and handling for rate limit errors

**Files Affected**:
- Added `src/config/index.ts`
- Added `src/utils/cache.ts`
- Added `src/utils/rateLimiter.ts`
- Updated GitHub API interactions in `src/api/github.ts`

**Benefits**:
- Reduced likelihood of hitting GitHub API rate limits
- Improved performance through caching
- Enhanced security through proper authentication
- More resilient handling of API errors
- Configurable security settings

**Changes Implemented**:
- Reorganized code into logical modules with clear responsibilities
- Implemented repository pattern for data access
- Created service layer for business logic
- Applied dependency injection via singleton instances
- Centralized configuration management
- Created utility modules for cross-cutting concerns
- Improved type safety through better interfaces
- Enhanced error handling structure
- Simplified main entry point

**New Directory Structure**:
- `src/api/` - External API clients
- `src/config/` - Configuration management
- `src/errors/` - Custom error types
- `src/models/` - Data models and interfaces
- `src/repositories/` - Data access layer
- `src/services/` - Business logic
- `src/tools/` - MCP tool implementations
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

**Benefits**:
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Enhanced testability through clear dependencies
- Better extensibility for adding new features
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More modular codebase
